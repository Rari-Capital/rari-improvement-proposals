## What is a RIP?

RIP stands for Rari Improvement Proposal, it has been adapted from the SIP (Synthetix Improvement Proposal) and YIP (Yearn Improvement Proposal) standards. RIPs are structured to present proposals to improve the Rari protocol and/or ecosystem. They should provide relative information surrounding the proposed change and objectively inform the community. The author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## RIP Rationale

We intend RIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions for changes to Rari Capital. Because they are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

It is highly recommended that a single RIP only contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the RIP, the easier it is to digest and the more successful it is likely to be.

A RIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement.


## RIP Work Flow

Parties involved in the process are the *author*, the [*RIP editors*](#rip-editors), and the Rari community.

:warning: Before you begin, vet your idea, this will save you time. Ask the Rari community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will have the intended effect. The appropriate public platform to gauge interest around your RIP is [the official Rari Telegram], [the official Rari Discord], or [the Rari Capital forums].

Your role as the champion is to write the RIP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea. Following is the process that a successful RIP will move along:

```
Proposed -> Approved -> Implementing -> Implemented
  ^                                         |
  +----> Rejected                           +----> Moribund
  |
  +----> Withdrawn
  v
Deferred
```

Each status change is requested by the RIP author and reviewed by the RIP editors. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where people should continue discussing your RIP. The RIP editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.
* **Work in progress (WIP)** -- Once the champion has asked the Rari community whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft RIP as a [pull request]. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in studying the RIP.
* **Proposed** If agreeable, a RIP editor will assign the RIP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the RIP) and merge your pull request. The RIP editor will not unreasonably deny a RIP. Proposed RIPs will be discussed on governance calls and in Discord. If there is a reasonable level of consensus around the change on the governance call the change will be moved to approved. If the change is contentious a vote of token holders may be held to resolve the issue or approval may be delayed until a consensus is reached.
* **Approved** -- This RIP has passed community governance and is now being prioritised for development.
* **Implementing** -- This RIP is currently being implemented.
* **Implemented** -- This RIP has been implemented and deployed to mainnet.
* **Rejected** -- This RIP has failed to reach community consensus.
* **Withdrawn** -- This RIP has been withdrawn by the author(s).
* **Deferred** -- This RIP is pending another RIP/some other change that should be bundled with it together.
* **Moribund** -- This RIP has been implemented and is now obsolete and requires no explicit replacement.

## What belongs in a successful RIP?

Each RIP should have the following parts:

- Preamble - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the RIP, including the RIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), and the author details.
- Simple Summary - “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the RIP.
- Background - Provide context to the problem your proposal wishes to address or to the area of the protocol you intend to improve.
- Abstract - Clearly describe how the proposal wishes to change/improve the protocol.
- Motivation - Motivation is critical for RIPs that want to change Rari. It should clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to address the problem that the RIP solves. RIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
- Specification - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.
- Test Cases - Test cases may be added during the implementation phase but are required before implementation.
- Copyright Waiver - All RIPs must be in the public domain. See the bottom of this RIP for an example copyright waiver.

## RIP Formats and Templates

RIPs should be written in [markdown] format.
Image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that RIP as follows: `assets/rip-X` (for rip **X**). When linking to an image in the RIP, use relative links such as `../assets/rip-X/image.png`.

## RIP Header Preamble

Each RIP must begin with an [RFC 822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt) style header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (`---`). This header is also termed ["front matter" by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

` yip:` <RIP number> (this is determined by the YIP editor)

` title:` <RIP title>

` author:` <a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s). Details are below.>

` * discussions-to:` \<a url pointing to the official discussion thread at forums.rari.capital\>

` status:` < WIP | PROPOSED | APPROVED | IMPLEMENTING | IMPLEMENTED >

` created:` <date created on>

` * updated:` <comma separated list of dates>

` * requires:` <RIP number(s)>

` * resolution:` \<a url pointing to the resolution of this RIP\>

Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.

Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).

#### `author` header

The `author` header optionally lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the RIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the author header value must be:

> Random J. User &lt;address@dom.ain&gt;

or

> Random J. User (@username)

if the email address or GitHub username is included, and

> Random J. User

if the email address is not given.

#### `discussions-to` header

While an RIP is in WIP or Proposed status, a `discussions-to` header will indicate the URL at [forums.rari.capital](https://forums.rari.capital/) where the RIP is being discussed.

#### `created` header

The `created` header records the date that the RIP was assigned a number. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

#### `updated` header

The `updated` header records the date(s) when the RIP was updated with "substantial" changes. This header is only valid for RIPs of Draft and Active status.

#### `requires` header

RIPs may have a `requires` header, indicating the RIP numbers that this RIP depends on.

## Auxiliary Files

RIPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be named RIP-XXXX-Y.ext, where “XXXX” is the RIP number, “X” is a serial number (starting at 1), and “ext” is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. “png”).

## RIP Editors

The current RIP editors are:

* `Jack Lipstone:` [GitHub](https://github.com/Jacklipstone)/[Forums](https://forums.rari.capital/u/JackLipstone)

* `Justin Yu:` [GitHub](https://github.com/JustinYu)/[Forums](https://forums.rari.capital/u/JustinYu)

* `Jai Bhavnani:` [GitHub](https://github.com/jbhav24)/[Forums](https://forums.rari.capital/u/jai)

* `David Lucid:` [GitHub](https://github.com/davidlucid)/[Forums](https://forums.rari.capital/u/davidlucid)

## RIP Editor Responsibilities

For each new RIP that comes in, an editor does the following:
Read the RIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.
The title should accurately describe the content.
Check the RIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (Github flavored Markdown), code style
If the RIP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.
Once the RIP is ready for the repository, the RIP editor will:
Assign an RIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this RIP)
Merge the corresponding pull request
Send a message back to the RIP author with the next step.
The RIP editors monitor RIP changes and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.
The editors don’t pass judgment on RIPs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part.


## History

The RIP document was derived heavily from the SIP (Synthetix Improvement Proposal) documents and Yearn Improvement Proposal documents and in many places, the text was simply copied and modified. Any comments about the RIP document should be directed to the RIP editors.
